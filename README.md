Hello World! My name is Enzo. I've only been to 1 of the 7 seas. When I learned about riptides they scared be senseless, but I haven't gotten myself into the water to surf. Until then, this fear will remain irrational as long as I don't think about the wind having a similar effect on me. Hard tacos are better than soft tacos. Perhaps it must be my refined palate or a longing to feel something which soft textures could never stimulate my insensitive and damaged tongue. I don't like to think about the latter, so I would prefer the former to be true.
